# Confidence-Aware-PCAM

Environmet used : Jetbrains Dataspell with python 3.9 downloadable from www.python.org

Hardware specifiation : Intel i9-10900k CPU, 128 GB RAM and NVIDIA RTX A4000 - 80GB GPU

Models : All the models can be found inside models folder and the corresponding python executables which are dependent on the model. The attention map, global pool and the utils can onlu be ran after runing the classifer.py with one Deep Learning backbone

Bin : Contains the necessary python executables to find out accuracy metrices or to reproduce the results 

Saliency Maps : As a part of explainable AI we provide a robust saliency maps module written in python which can be used with any of the models to help understand the internal working of the DL models or to reproduce the results.
